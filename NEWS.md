# AutoSpectralRcpp 1.0.5 (2026-02-24)

## New features
- Fast kernel density estimation for gating and plotting in AutoSpectral.


# AutoSpectralRcpp 1.0.0 (2026-02-10)

## New features
- Parallelized C++ assignment and unmixing of per-cell autofluorescence

## Improvements
- Faster (~10x) per-cell optimization using residual-alignment pre-screening.
- Import functions from AutoSpectral rather than duplicating.


# AutoSpectralRcpp 0.2.0 (2025-12-07)

## New features
- Added fast Poisson–IRLS unmixing with incremental updates.
- Added OpenMP support with optimized C++ kernels.
- Implemented new SSM calculation pipeline.

## Improvements
- Faster Poisson–IRLS unmixing with fast QR decomposition
- Better handling of convergence with step halving, deviance monitoring
- Allow early exit if convergence reached
- unmix.wls updated to match AutoSpectral, ensuring non-negative weighting and
a more numerically stable solve.
- Hopefully faster compiler flags.


## Bug fixes
- Initial estimates for IRLS are no longer clamped to non-negative values
- Indentation error in optimize_unmix_rcpp_woodbury
